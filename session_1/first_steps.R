# vector
# let's create a simple scalar

# sequence stored to an object

# matrix, (n x m), same type
# combine to vectors a matrix

# data.frame, (n x m) different types

# turn them into a data.frame

# add a logical column

# what kind of object are we dealing with?
# what structure does the object have?

# lists, entirely different, 
# note an R function can only 
# return one object. This makes lists 
# very important.

# but all of our elements from above in one list


# look at the global environment ls()
# realize that this is a big difference 
# to STATA and SPSS etc ??
