## Syllabus
(translated from the German schedule of the University of Constance)
Being data savvy and able to extract information from collected data has become an inevitable skill across disciplines. This course gives a hands-on introduction to modern data analysis and shows how statistical analysis can be run in an efficient and reproducible way using the R language for Statistical Computing and its ecosystem. Besides the application of popular statistical methods the course covers how to create dynamic documents with R and markup languages such as LaTeX or Markdown. The creation of such documents is discussed with academic reports, term paper or bachelor and master thesis' in mind.
