## Slide 1: Title

- my name is matthias, we will have the opportunity 
to introduces ourselves in a minute, but first a little bit
about the course

- the course is called exploring statistics with R and
should give you insights how programming can help you to understand 
statistics better and make life easier. Programming is not for everyone, 
this course should help you to find out whether it's for you. 
Everyone should be able to get the credits -- even those who 
find out programming is not for them. 

- the course is very interactive. It's not a stats course. 
its not methoden or statistik II or III. It's how you would what you 
already know using programming. 

- The course how you would like it to be. If you want program your own estimator
let's do it. If you have a dataset that gives you trouble - let's have a look. 
If always wanted to know what the magic behind regression really does.. let's 
lift the curtain. 

## Slide 2: About ... well that's me... 
- introduce Niels, please take some notes Niels
- say something about you and way you choose this course. 
- please say a little bit, more than your name, we need
to form teams, because modern programming is often done
using peer programming / code reviews are important. 


## Slide 3: Interactive... What do already know on Aggregate?

## Slide 4: Why code? 

## Slide 5: Because
